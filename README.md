# Caesar's Cipher UI

Welcome to my first Python Project.

This project consists of a classic Caesar's Cipher integrated in an UI.

The purpose of this proyect is displaying a simple UI for the classic "Caesar's Cipher" code.

Caesar's cipher uses a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.

Apart from encoding messages, the code can also decode messages knowing the fixed number of positions the letters switch.

I made the UI with tkinter.
